How long did the assignment take?
About 8 hours

Potential issues with your solution and explanation of partial completion (for partial credit)
I believe everything is correct, although some of the things like 2-segment testing was difficult.
The results obtained were verified against the images in the pset and by "eyeballing" the output.

Any extra credit you may have implemented
None :(

What was most unclear/difficult?
How to do the rotation, and a bit of the stuff regarding the PQ vectors for the segment warping. It was
sometimes difficult to go from the formulas on the slides to the actual objects in code.

What was most exciting?
Morphing the face, especially when N = 5 so it was a nice gradual change. Also seeing things work in general...

Note: all of the output images were generated through a2test.py. The output is in the output folder.
